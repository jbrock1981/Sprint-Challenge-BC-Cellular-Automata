2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

running a ton of computer resources usually through GPU's and guessing the hash and values for the next block with brute force

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

solves transmission problems with a set of rules like for traffic control systems, network traffic in a router, computing simulations for anything from universe expansion to galaxy rotation and even down to disease spread pathways
